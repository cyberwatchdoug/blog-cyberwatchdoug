  How to achieve more by spending time reading API reference and schema docs
title: Quick Wins by Reading API Reference
---

I know it can be tedious and more of a time sink to read through API reference or schema. But it is absolutely worth it, especially if you also take notes for yourself.

Let me explain. I have been wrapping my head around how I can get up and running with using CloudNativePG for my databases. Starting with Linkding, but have plans to expand it to a half dozen other self-hosted apps.

I didn't want to just copy someone else's manifest, or ask GenAI to create a manifest for me. I took the time to read what each field was for, and went down the rabbit hole reading first the `Cluster` reference, then `ClusterSpec` and several deeper fields within that.

It took time as I made notes in Obsidian, with references back to the specific API schema pages. But now I've got a deeper understanding, and have plenty of notes to write about for places like this and other social media outlets.

CloudNativePG is amazing with their API Reference documentation, as is Kubernetes. I know that's not the case for all of them. But I wanted to point out how beneficial it can be if you take the time to read through it and make your own notes.
